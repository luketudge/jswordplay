# jswordplay

A crappy minimal template for processing text input and displaying the results with (ðŸ¤®) JavaScript.

[texthighlight.js](texthighlight.js) does the work. The `highlight_words` function attaches a `<span class="highlighted">` tag to words in a string that match those defined in [target_words.js](target_words.js). An appropriate entry in [style.css](style.css) determines the consequences of this tag for display.

I hate JavaScript. But probably not as much as it hates me.
